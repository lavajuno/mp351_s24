			<h1>The Great COSI Move of 2024</h1>

			<h2>Planning</h2>
			<p>
				Helped develop the new topology, got our handoff from OIT in
				COLO with Sophia, helped clear out servers from COLO in
				preparation for the move.
			</p>

			<h2>The Servery</h2>
			<p>
				Re-routed and labelled cables, helped clean up the server 
				room. Configured FHILL to handle traffic to/from COLO properly
				and showed Amity + Anthony Mikrotik RouterOS.
			</p>

			<h2>COLO</h2>
			<p>
				TalDos and Kasper initially had some problems after the move to
				COLO. Visiting COLO for some wiring and configuration changes,
				I was able to get everything operational.

			<h1>* Book</h1>
			<p>
				Lots of new information about the network, servers, and services
				that they run is now in book. A lot of information has been
				updated after the Great Move, and Book has seen some new
				contributors.
			</p>

		<div class="content">
			<h1>Janet and Elephant</h1>
			<p>
				Janet is a new compute/memory specialized VM host. It is set
				up identically to Hydra to keep things consistent for students.
				<br>
				Elephant is now operational (running TrueNAS Scale 23.10) and
				mounted in the IBM rack.
			</p>

		<div class="content">
			<h1>KiCad Mirror</h1>
			<p>
				We are now the official North American mirror for KiCad. It took
				a lot of correspondance but it's set up on both ends now.
			</p>
		</div>
		<br>

		<div class="content">
			<h1>Caddy on Tiamat</h1>
			<p>
				Tiamat now uses Caddy to reverse proxy to the services it runs.
				A couple new contributors (Amity and Anthony) made commits on
				Github to get services working with Caddy.
			</p>
		</div>
		<br>

		<div class="content">
			<h1>* Wallace, Gromit, and TalTres</h1>
			<p>
				I went to COLO with Cary, Nathan, and Sophia to set up TalTres,
				Wallace, and Gromit. TalTres is now our primary DNS and DHCP
				server. Wallace and Gromit are part of a Proxmox cluster for
				hosting VMs and containers.
